# 💼 Flutter Profile Card App

A clean and minimal profile card built with **Flutter**. This app shows off basic Flutter layout techniques using:

- 🧑‍🎨 `CircleAvatar` for profile image  
- 🎨 Custom fonts & text styles  
- ✉️ `ListTile` inside `Card` widgets for contact info  
- 📏 `SizedBox` and `Divider` for spacing  
- 📱 Beautiful layout with `SafeArea` and `Column`
